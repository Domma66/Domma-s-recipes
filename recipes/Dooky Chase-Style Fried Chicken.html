    <p>
        I'm going to show you my version of the famous New Orleans restaurant's 
        famous fried chicken, Dooky Chase-Style Fried Chicken, and although it 
        is shockingly simple, it is likely the most beautiful and delicious fried 
        chicken you will ever make at home.
    </p>

    <p>
        This very simple (yet thoroughly amazing) Dooky Chase-style fried chicken has 
        two major differences when compared to other great Southern fried chickens.First 
        of all, we’re using an egg-based marinade instead of the ubiquitous buttermilk or 
        milk wash. Secondly, the chefs at Dooky Chase’s are more than happy to explain how 
        they make it, and what they put in it. Allegedly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe they’re just generous, which from all reports they are, but it also might come 
        from knowing that even if folks can make their own at home, more than enough will still 
        come to the restaurant to enjoy the ambience and all their other fine offerings. Yes, 
        you have to be an extremely confident restaurant to give away the secret to your signature 
        dish, and it’s hard to think of other examples of this very rare behavior. 
    </p>

        The only part of their method I didn’t follow was cooking the chicken in a giant, commercial 
        grade deep fryer. Nope, as you can see in the video, I used a way too small pot on the stove, 
        which I’m now reminding you not to do. Actually, the pot was fine — it was the amount of chicken 
        I tried to fry. If you’re using a set up like mine, fry the chicken in batches so as not to overflow 
        the grease into the flame. Seriously, Google “deep fried turkey fires” in case you’re not convinced. 
        Anyway, if you can avoid burning down your kitchen (and you can), I really do hope you give this incredible 
        fried chicken a try soon. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons fine salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Seasoned Flour</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together 4 teaspoons salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, and 2 tablespoons of spice mix thoroughly together in a mixing bowl large enough to hold all chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Cut whole chicken into serving-size pieces, ending up with 2 breast halves, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, and 2 wings. Alternately, you can use 4 pounds of bone-in, skin-on pre-cut chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Add chicken pieces to the egg marinade and toss thoroughly until evenly coated. Press and compact chicken pieces down into the bowl so they are covered with marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic, and marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. Toss chicken pieces several times during the marinating process.</li>
        <li>Mix flour and the 1 teaspoon salt together in a shallow pan.</li>
        <li>Preheat vegetable oil for deep frying to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>When ready to fry, use tongs to pull chicken out of marinade, letting excess marinade drip off. Coat thoroughly with seasoned flour, and shake off excess. Carefully place in the hot oil.</li>
        <li>If your fryer is large enough to accommodate the whole chicken, add breast pieces first, and fry for 3 to 4 minutes before adding thighs, legs, and wings. Once all the chicken is in the oil, 
            fry for 15 to 18 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a rack to drain, and let cool 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
